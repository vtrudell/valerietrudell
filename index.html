            <p>
                My name is Valerie Trudell. I currently live in Tampa, Florida. I have been a software developer for the last 6 years. I started 7 years ago at Turing School of Software and Design where I learned to code in Ruby on Rails and Javascript(ES5 and ES6). Before I'd graduate there I also attended a Threat Detection Course in 2017. I then went on to work in start ups, working with Ruby on Rails doing back-end development, front-end development at Takl and Kaleris. I then started at Stem Disintermedia as a Senior Software Engineer where I worked in Python/Djaongo and React. I then worked at a start up called Cre8tive Software Development where I taught courses and currated content which involved the creation of software development projects.
